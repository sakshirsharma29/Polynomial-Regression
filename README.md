# Polynomial-Regression Implementation

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the implementation of polynomial regression, a common technique in machine learning used for modeling nonlinear relationships between variables. The notebook serves as both an educational resource and a practical example for beginners and enthusiasts in data science and machine learning.
Note: This project is created purely for learning purposes and is ideal for those who want to understand the basics of polynomial regression and its application in data modeling.

# Features
- Polynomial Regression: Step-by-step implementation using Python and popular libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analysis of the dataset to understand its characteristics and suitability for regression modeling.
- Visualization: Graphical representations of the data and the regression model's fit.
- Performance Evaluation: Metrics to assess the quality of the regression model.

# Prerequisites

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required libraries:
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas to improve the notebook or expand its features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
